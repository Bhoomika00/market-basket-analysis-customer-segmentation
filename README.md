# 🛒 Market Basket Analysis & Customer Segmentation (ML Coursework)

## 📌 Overview  
This project applies **association rule mining** and **customer segmentation** techniques to retail transaction data to uncover purchasing patterns and customer groups. The work was completed as part of my MSc AI  Machine Learning coursework at **Oxford Brookes University**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Discover frequent itemsets and product associations using **Apriori**  
- Generate actionable **association rules** for product recommendations  
- Segment customers using **K-Means clustering** based on purchasing behaviour  
- Apply **PCA** for dimensionality reduction and cluster visualisation  

---

## 🧠 Key Techniques  
- Market Basket Analysis (Apriori Algorithm)  
- Association Rules (support, confidence, lift)  
- Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)  
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)  
- Data preprocessing, feature encoding, scaling  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- mlxtend (Apriori & association rules)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Lower support thresholds revealed meaningful multi-item purchase patterns  
- Strong associations found between themed or complementary products  
- Customer clusters identified based on frequency, total spend, and quantity  
- PCA helped visualise distinct customer groups
